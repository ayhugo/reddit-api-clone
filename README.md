## Description
Last video we got our basic project structure setup with routes, controllers, and models. In this video, we start with mentally mapping out our models. From there, we begin to build out the models / controllers and explore different features of [Mongoose.js](http://mongoosejs.com/) such as references between our models and middleware to populate the fields. If you like the series feel free to star this repo and share it with your friends! Be on the look out for parts 3 & 4.
